        <p>The NFL fan base keeps growing and its revenues are reaching new heights, with the league anticipating $25 billion in revenue by 2027, according to NBC Sports.</p>

        <p>Yet a potential weakness for the league is the increased fear of traumatic brain injury as a result of contact sports. That had led to a steady decline in football participation at the youth level, according to The Washington Post, hitting an all-time low in 2021-2022. </p>

        <p>But the sport had a bounce back at the youth level last year, according to my new analysis of the most recent data from NFHS, which includes the 2022-2023 season. Participation rates were up for the year by about 5%, with 1,032,415 number of children ages 14-18 participating. </p>

        <p>While the increase is higher than the last few seasons, it is still lower than the previous ten years. In this article, we will look to see if high school football is declining and what is the reason behind it. We will also see how that could potentially affect the next levels.</p>

        <p>In Detroit, kids' love for football starts in youth leagues like the Police Athletic League. There, kids learn about the skills needed to play, and off the field skills like leadership and being team oriented. When the kids become of age, they transition to high school in hopes of showcasing their talent on a bigger stage. For the athletically gifted, they are then able to get recruited to play in college. With the recent decline that pipeline is now uncertain. So where are these players and teams going?</p>

        <p>In “The Changing Face of America’s Favorite Sport,” Dave Sheinin and Emily Giambalvo break down how race, class and politics divided a sport that was once a connector. In the article, participation rates and surveys showed a hesitancy even from parents that were former players at allowing their kids to play football. The biggest factor was awareness of the effects of concussions and CTE. More affluent parents have more alternatives such as other sports or the rise of flag football, thus far mainly in wealthier communities. Children coming from better situations also don’t face the pressure of needing to play football in hopes of being the family’s primary provider.</p>

        <p>College football programs have already begun to adjust their recruiting to account for fewer participants coming out of high school. In 2021, the transfer portal’s one time transfer exception was created to allow student athletes to switch programs without sitting out a season. For former Syracuse defensive back Malcolm Folk he has seen first hand how college football was changed. Folk recalls attending a meeting led by former defensive coordinator Tony White on where the college football landscape was shifting towards. Folk said, “Syracuse will be mainly getting guys from the portal and high school classes will be shrinking and that is very evident right now.” In White’s tenure (2020-2022), high school recruiting slightly decreased while transfer portal increased. Despite the coaching change this offseason,​​ the Orange’s approach remained the same. While there was a slight decrease in the percentage of new additions coming through the portal, Syracuse was able to add 13 players, up three from the previous year. This approach gives college football the option to shrink high school recruiting and take more experienced and mature players out of the portal.  </p>

        <p>While the previous participation numbers have been trending down, the numbers in football began to rise again this year. This was despite the fewest number of teams in the last ten years. While the 2018-2019 season looked to have started this trend, how much did the Covid-19 pandemic affect the numbers, with football being canceled or limited during those two seasons. The NFHS does not have numbers for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 seasons due to the outlier seasons. While there has been a decline in boy’s participation rates, there has also been a rise in girl’s participation, with this year being their biggest turnout. The rise has been so prevalent that colleges around the country have started to add women flag football teams and allow women to play positions men's teams.</p>

        <p>While football looks different than previous years, its participation should continue to grow by finding new ways of inclusivity.</p>
